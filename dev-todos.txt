Features:
  * Search by zone
  * Outfit saving
  * Pet states

UI Improvements:
  * Use the space better on big screens?
  * Present invalidated items somewhere on the screen, instead of them just vanishing? :/
  * New assets? 🤔

Tech/detail improvements:
  * Use react-virtualized instead of our own scroller, but we need total count known, and we need another solution for the CSS transitions in the outfit case
  * Restore good download behavior: use crossOrigin for everything, and remove cache-buster in the URL we use for canvas
  * Undo the local linking we did for @chakra-ui/core, react, and react-dom on Matchu's machine 😅
