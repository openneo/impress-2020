    // still allowing non-body-specific items in those zones! (I think this
    // happens for some Invisible pet stuff, too?)

    //       should be doing this way earlier, to prevent the item from even
    //       showing up even in search results!

    //       zone, like Static, so long as the item isn't body-specific! That's
    //       correct, and the item layer should be on top! (Here, we implement
    //       it by placing item layers second in the list, and rely on JS sort
    //       stability, and *then* rely on the UI to respect that ordering when
    //       rendering them by depth. Not great! ðŸ˜…)

    //       this condition, not just the restricted zones, as a sensible
    //       defensive default, even though we weren't aware of any relevant
    //       items. But now we know that actually the "Bruce Brucey B Mouth"
    //       occupies the real Mouth zone, and still should be visible and
    //       above pet layers! So, we now only check *restricted* zones.
    //
    // NOTE: UCs used to implement their restrictions by listing specific
    //       zones, but it seems that the logic has changed to just be about
    //       UC-ness and body-specific-ness, and not necessarily involve the
    //       set of restricted zones at all. (This matters because e.g. UCs
    //       shouldn't show _any_ part of the Rainy Day Umbrella, but most UCs
    //       don't restrict Right-Hand Item (Zone 49).) Still, I'm keeping the
    //       zone restriction case running too, because I don't think it
    //       _hurts_ anything, and I'm not confident enough in this conclusion.

    //       use zone restrictions?
